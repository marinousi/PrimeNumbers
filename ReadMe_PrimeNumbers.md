# PRIME NUMBERS

Firstly, I made two variables; one of them will hold the quantity of the prime numbers (**int prime**) up to the given integer stated by the user, and the other will be used as a type of assistant in further math counts (**int holder**). In order to look through all of the numbers up to the integer, I made one for (it starts with 2 because the _holder_ would only once be equals to zero, which is in the first case when both _i_ and _j_ are one; also, apart from one, the minimum quantity of numbers that has a prime is two) and another for to figure it out if the number is even or prime. If the rest of the division between _i_ and _j_ equals zero, then it means it’s an even number and the _holder_ integer will be added one to its quantity. But if not, then it means _holder_ is equal to zero (the rest of the operation _[i % j]_ is not zero, therefore the operation _holder++_ wasn’t completed), and the prime integer will be added one to its quantity.
